octal

For example, the following would trigger the octal_mode lint rule:

mode: 123 (invalid octal mode)
mode: abc (invalid octal mode)
mode: 0abc (invalid octal mode)
On the other hand, the following would pass the octal_mode lint rule:

mode: 0755 (valid octal mode)
mode: 0644 (valid octal mode)
mode: 0777 (valid octal mode)
